This is template project for android MDD framework extension
Follow the below tutorial to rename this template and create your own project 

Tutorial - Developing a mobile application named school for Schools.
---------

1. Create the project
   -Refactor root java source directory template -> school
   -Rename assets/template.sql -> assets/school.sql
   -Change rootProject.name in settings.gradle
   -change applicationId in build.gradle: template.app -> school.app
   -change name in .project file
   -change the app name in app.MainActivity   template -> school

   Build and veryfy your changes are working. If necessary revalidate cache in andrioid studio

2. Creating my first UI (Fragment)
   2.1. Copy the FragmentTemplateUI from app and create the fragment StudentRegUI  and copy the layout fragmenttemplate_ui and create the layout for StudentRegUI The layout file named as studentreg_ui
        please note the naming convention for class file and layout file of the UI
   2.2. Refactor the id other details in studentreg_ui: ItemRegUI->StudentRegUI, change MainActivity navigation to navigate to the this newly created fragment
   2.3  Customize the template layout to match the attributes of a Student Index Number, First Name, Last Name, Address, Age

3. Writing my first Action
   3.1. Create the action class StudentRegUIFind  in actions package of your project and extend it from FBaseAction
        Here framework automatically binds your action to the find button of the StudentRegUI by following the naming convention <UIName><buttonId>  for action.

4. Reading data from UI and show that in the message
   To read data from view (UI), the field ids must follow the convention <ClassNameInFirstLetterSmall>_<identifier>
   4.1 Reading values from view as basic data type values such as String, Integer etc.
       Change the field id firstName -> string_firstName
       Similarly you can read other fields also

5. Updating View
   5.1 Writing the clear action
       The StudentRegUIClear action is automatically bound to the clear action by the framework. We use it here to demonstrate how to update view.
       Bugs: The action may not work due to the bugs in android studio. Build project or try reloading the files or invalidating the cache in android studio
       Using similar technique, you can change this as a clear method of StudentRegUI

6. Using a model to simplify actions
   6.1 Create a Student model in the model package with all the required attributes appropriate getters and setters
       All models must extend the Identifiable class or one of its derived class. It gives some inherited attributes to the model class
   6.2 To bind Student model to the view, Refactor (rename) the field ids in the layout file studentreg_ui to reflect the Class name and the attributes names of the Student model
       Use the format <ClassNameInFirstLetterSmall>_<identifier> E.g. string_index -> student_index
       Use a similar technique to clear the view

7. Save (Persist) data to database
   7.1 Write the table definition of the student model in the assests/school.sql file.
       Table name is <ClassNameInFirstLetterSmall>
       A long id field must be defined because that the Student model is derived from Identifier model
   7.2 Remove the app from device and rerun the application. Now you can observe the student table is automatically created by the framework, using the database inspector
   7.3 Oops index is a sql keyword. Refactor index -> indexNo
       Now you can inspect the Student table in the school db
   7.4 Create the first save action to save Student
       All actions which need to save data must be derived class of SaveAction therefore create a action StudentRegUISave and extend it from SaveAction
       

       
  


       







1. How to create periodic action
1.1. create a action by extending the right baseAction
1.2. register the action in ActionRegister class
P.S. PeriodicActionsService must be registered in AndroidManifest as service


Limitations of periodic actions
1. PERIODIC_FOREGROUND action can be associated with only one view
2. All PERIODIC_FOREGROUND actions run when the app is visible however
optimally action should run only when the associated UI visible
3. Period between executions may vary in the order of milliseconds


Implementation Note
===================
Each periodic action is executed by a separate timer. It creates a separate thread for each action.
Alternatively, a single timer can be used.

According to periodic actions a device can be in 5 states
1. Device startup
2. App started by the icon after device startup
3. App went to background by pressing android home button
4. App closed by removing it from recent list
5. App started by the IDE run button (only happens at development time)
